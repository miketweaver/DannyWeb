## The Why

I created this website to showcase my abilaties and experiences in the cyber security industry and pertaining fields.
LinkedIn is good for professional discussion, as Twitter is for informal talk. These may not be well suited to present projects in comparison to GitHub, where project colaboration is encouraged.

A personal blog can bring together many of these positive traits of these websites, demonstrating some of what I can do.
I can share what I have learned. An opportunity to give back.

## The What

Some topics to expect in the near future include insight into defensive operations, task automation, or practical knowledge in cyber security.

Projects will be presented that I am actively working on, events that I participate in, groups I engage with, there will be many things to share in the future.

## The Who

My name is Danny Child. I work in the cyber security field. My opportunities to learn are always within hand's reach.
